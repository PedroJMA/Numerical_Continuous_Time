# Numerical Methods in Continuous Time

### By Joao B. Duarte (www.jbduarte.com)

I have replicated in Python codes of Benjamin Moll, SeHyoun Ahn, and Pontus Rendahl for a variety of economic models set in continuous time.
I am indebted to their rich publicly available material.

Please let me know of any bugs you may find. (joao.duarte@novasbe.pt)
